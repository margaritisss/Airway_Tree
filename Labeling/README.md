[[MedIA](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2024.103367)] Efficient anatomical labeling of pulmonary tree structures via deep point-graph representation-based implicit fields 

Preprint: [arXiv:2309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17329)


## :bookmark_tabs:Data Preparation

We open source a new Pulmonary Tree Labeling dataset, which includes 799 subjects, including the 3D volumes of binary shapes of pulmonary airway, artery and vein for each subject. The dataset is divided into 559 subjects for training, 80 cases for validation, and 160 cases for testing. 

## :Specifications

We have included a folder 'specs' that contains detailed specfication for this project.

'dataset_specs_XXX.json' --- details regarding the dataset that the program will run on. 

## :nut_and_bolt: Installation

1. Create a virtual environment `conda create -n ipgn python=3.9` and activate it `conda activate ipgn`
2. Download the code`git clone https://github.com/M3DV/pulmonary-tree-labeling.git`
3. Enter the project folder `cd pulmonary-tree-labeling` and run `conda install --yes --file requirements.txt`

## :bulb:Get Started

1. Download the PTL datasets (airway, artery, vein) ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fi088yjdRgmXbI629hZuXoQfHMbF2gcV?usp=sharing))

   optional: Download the derived Graph skeleton (airway, artery, vein) dataset ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RqmiG_G0pwRMoQ7AAfXbDgsZ3zNSz9cB?usp=sharing)). The graph-based information is already included in the "processed" (pytorch_geometric dataset) folder in the PTL dataset.

Place the downloaded PTL datasets to under the `pulmonary-tree-labeling` directory.

2. Download the pre-trained Model Checkpoints([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gWs-PAnypQez9l9Qg1FNkx8XNXjnHW8q?usp=sharing))

   We offer the pre-trained IPGN models, which has been trained on the PTL dataset independently on airway, artery and vein. This pre-trained model can be directly used for Inference if you do not want to re-train the Model. Simply download the folder to under the `pulmonary-tree-labeling` directory.

3. Decide the dataset that the algorithm will be running on:
   The specification file for each pulmonary structure dataset are in the 'specs' folder, and with json filename starting with 'dataset_specs'. 
   e.g. dataset_specs_airway.json

## :microscope:Train IPGN

Training from stretch:

> ✨**Note**: Before running the following command, make sure you are inside the 'pulmonary-tree-labeling' folder.

```bash
python train_network.py -d $dataset_specs_json_file 
```
e.g. python train_network.py -d dataset_specs_airway.json


## :chart_with_upwards_trend:Inference

Start inference:

> ✨**Note**: Before running the following command, make sure you are inside the `pulmonary-tree-labeling` folder.

```bash
python reconstruction_inference.py -d $dataset_specs_json_file 
```

In the dataset specs file, if "Save_Reconstruction_Volume" is set to 1, the script will save the reconstructed 3D volume to the "Result_Save_Path"
as directory.
